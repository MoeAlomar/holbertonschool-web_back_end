In this module I will implement a method that will help in pagination
specifically in calculating the starting and ending index to reach the
starting point of a page that you choose.

    In this method we will calculate the start index and end index
    to reach a specific page with a limited page size.

        page (int): the page number we want to reach (starting from 1).
        page_size (int): the size of each page.

    Returns:
        tuple: combination of the start_index and the end_index.

        n: (number of page)
